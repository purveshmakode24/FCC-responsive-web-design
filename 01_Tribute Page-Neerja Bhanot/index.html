        <h2 class="tpadding50">Hijacking in Karachi, Pakistan</h2>
        Pan AM Flight 73 was hijacked by four armed Palestinian men from the Abu Nidal Organization while preparing to depart Karachi for Frankfurt Airport before arriving at its ultimate destination: John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, United States. The aircraft had just arrived from Mumbai, India, with 380 passengers on board.

    The hijackers were disguised as Karachi airport security guards and armed with assault rifles, pistols, grenades and plastic explosive belts.

    They stormed up the stairways into the plane, fired shots from an automatic weapon, and seized control of the aircraft.

        <h2 class="tpadding20"> Neerja's Bravery </h2>
    Neerja was able to alert the cockpit crew using the intercom, allowing the pilot, co-pilot, and flight engineer to flee through an overhead hatch in the cockpit. This prevented the hijackers from forcing the plane to take off, thwarting their plans.

    She was now the most senior member of the crew on board.

    When ordered to collect passengers' passports, Neerja believed those with American passports would be singled out by the hijackers. She proceeded to hide some of the American passports under a seat, and dumped the rest down a rubbish chute.

    At some point during the 17-hour stand-off, Neerja secretly removed a page from her manual that explained procedures for how to open the exit door and deploy the slide down to the apron; she placed it inside of a magazine and then handed it to the passenger near one of the doors. She instructed him to read the magazine and then close it up, but refer to it later if necessary.

    Later, after power outages and panicked shooting by the hijackers, some crew members and passengers rallied to open the exit doors. The passenger who had read the page Neerja gave him earlier was able to successfully open door 3R. It was the only door opened to have the slide deploy.

    Ultimately, this slide allowed for more passengers to evacuate safely and without injuries.

    Neerja assisted a number of passengers to escape from the plane and then she sacrificed herself shielding three children from the bullets fired by the terrorists. In the end, twenty passengers were killed and over a hundred were injured.

     <h2 class="tpadding20">Aftermath</h2>
    All of the hijackers were captured and sentenced to death in Pakistan, but their sentences were commuted to life imprisonment despite objections from both India and the U.S.
